    <h1>Italian Bread</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade Italian bread is actually very easy to make and tastes delicious! 
        While you could buy a loaf of Italian bread from the grocery store, baking bread is 
        fun and satisfying. Warm, toasty bread from the oven is pure comfort food.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast or 2 packets</li>
        <li>1/2 cup warm water</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups hot water, hot to the touch but not boiling</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5-6 cups all-purpose flour, add more if needed to get to a pliable dough</li>
        <li>1 large egg white, for brushing on loaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="numbered-list">
        <li>Dissolve yeast, 1/2 cup warm water, and 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl or stand mixer, combine 2 cups hot water, 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, 
            salt, and oil. Add 3 cups of flour to the mixture in this large bowl/mixer and mix well. 
            Stir in yeast mixture.</li>
        <li>Add 2 – 3 cups more flour and mix until well blended. (At this point your dough will still 
            be quite sticky). Leave in bowl, cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour. (If using a mixer, 
            remove the bowl from the mixer and cover. Otherwise your paddle attachment or dough hook will 
            get covered in dough when it rises). NO KNEADING IS REQUIRED.</li>
        <li>After the rise, if the dough is too sticky to handle, add more flour until its workable. 
            For some people this can be up to a cup or more! Just don't dry out the dough. Add by quarter 
            cupfuls until its workable.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 2 (or 3 if you want smaller loaves) pieces. Roll out each piece on a floured 
            surface into the length desired then roll up lengthwise like a jelly roll. If it's still too sticky, 
            add more flour until it's workable but not dry.</li>
        <li>Put on a greased cookie sheet, sealed side down, and tuck the ends under. Slash the top diagonally 
            across the top every couple of inches with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Cover and let loaves rise 30 more minutes.</li>
        <li>While loaves are rising, preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>Whisk the egg white and brush over the top of loaves.</li>
        <li>Bake for 25 – 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
